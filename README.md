Man, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Jumbo, and I don't even know where to start, seriously. Like, who makes a   about a girl falling in love with a freakin' amusement park ride? It's wild. I mean, sure, she had her reasons, but you gotta admit it's kinda out there. Maybe I'm just not artsy enough to get it, but still, it kept me up, so there's that.

So there I was, thinking it'll just be another quirky indie 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 to add to the list, and then bam! You're 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this girl legit express her feelings for a machine. And the craziest part? You kind of get sucked into it too. Like, am I supposed to be feeling this way about a bunch of metal and lights? Not sure if it's the script or the late-night vibes, but it kind of hit differently.

> At some point, I thought, Did I really just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for this? But somehow, I couldn’t stop 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  . The aesthetics were dope though, gotta give 'em that. They really nailed that whole whimsical-but-creepy vibe, you know what I mean? And her mom... oh my God. Talk about an overbearing parent. One moment she's all concerned, next she's like Whatever makes you happy. Make up your mind already!

Anyway, the pacing was kinda slow in parts, but maybe that’s just me. Had me looking at my phone more than once, but hey, it happens, right? It’s still stuck in my brain now like some oddball dream I can't shake off.

If nothing else, Jumbo’s got me half-questioning what love really means—and half-guessing I should get some sleep. Maybe this   thing messed with my head more than I thought. Catch you later, dude, before I start pondering if my coffee machine's got feelings, lol!
